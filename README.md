# Abihome Image Downloader

This Python script downloads images from a user account of the platform "abihome.de". This software is not related in
any way to the company "Abihome GmbH" which owns the platform "abihome.de".

## Why?

I graduated from high school in 2019, and we used "abihome.de" at that time to design our high school graduation book. A
lot of pictures of the whole class level were uploaded. Since I didn't have all the images, but I also didn't feel like
downloading every image via the web GUI, I wrote this script that allowed me to download every image automatically
within a short time. This allows me to reminisce about the wonderful moments without spending a lot of effort.

## Usage

This script is tested with Python 3.10. Before starting, please enter the "abihome.de" credentials in the ".env" file.
